    <div class="divtag"><li><b><i> Sharks do not have bones.</i></b></li></div>
    <p id="text"> Sharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known as "elasmobranchs", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissuesâ€”the clear gristly stuff that your ears and nose tip are made of. This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates. Their cartilaginous skeletons are much lighter than true bone and their large livers are full of low-density oils, both helping them to be buoyant.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="divtag"><li><b><i>Each whale shark's spot pattern is unique as a fingerprint.</i></b></li></div>
    <p id="text">Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the ocean. They can grow to 12.2 meters and weigh as much as 40 tons by some estimates! Basking sharks are the world's second largest fish, growing as long as 32 feet and weighing more than five tons.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="divtag"><li><b><i>Scientists age sharks by counting the rings on their vertebrae.</i></b></div></li></div>
    <p id="text">Vertebrae contain concentric pairs of opaque and translucent bands. Band pairs are counted like rings on a tree and then scientists assign an age to the shark based on the count. Thus, if the vertebrae has 10 band pairs, it is assumed to be 10 years old. Recent studies, however, have shown that this assumption is not always correct. Researchers must therefore study each species and size class to determine how often the band pairs are deposited because the deposition rate may change over time. Determining the actual rate that the bands are deposited is called "validation".</p>
    <br>
    <div class="divtag"><li><b><i>Shark skin feels similar to sandpaper.</i></b></li></div>
    <p id="text"> Shark skin feels exactly like sandpaper because it is made up of tiny teeth-like structures called placoid scales, also known as dermal denticles. These scales point towards the tail and help reduce friction from surrounding water when the shark swims. </p>
    <br>
    <div class="divtag"><li><b><i>Sharks have special electroreceptor organs.</i></b></li></div>
    <p id="text">Sharks have small black spots near the nose, eyes, and mouth. These spots are the ampullae of Lorenzini-special electroreceptor organs that allow the shark to sense electromagnetic fields and temperature shifts in the ocean. </p>
