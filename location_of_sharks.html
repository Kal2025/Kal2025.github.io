<p id="text"> Generally, are found in Atlantic coastal waters and along the Pacific Coast. Among those reported in the U.S. include the great white shark (or simply known as the white shark)—which are among the top predators—and the whale shark, the world's largest fish.
According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there are over 50 species of sharks in the waters off the country's East Coast alone.
The Shark Research Committee, a nonprofit research group, says there have been at least 34 shark species recorded off the Pacific Coast, mostly around California, Alaska and Oregon in the U.S. most Sharks </p>

<p id="text">Sharks in the East Coast range from the small spiny dogfish to the much larger white shark and the sharks here are "found in just about every kind of ocean habitat," the NOAA says.
 The Atlantic blacktip, spinner, Atlantic sharpnose and lemon sharks are among the species more prominent in nearshore waters of the coast's southeast region.
 Sandbar, sand tiger and smooth dogfish sharks frequent the waters near the shore of the Mid-Atlantic region, especially during the summer. These are also found in New England waters, where spiny dogfish and white sharks also commonly swim in search of their natural prey, according to the NOAA.
Most Atlantic sharks are reported to spend at least a portion of their lives in coastal waters. Many species go in search of food through the bays and estuaries along the U.S. coast.
Other species are known to be "open-ocean dwellers that use shallower waters as nurseries or occasional feeding grounds," the NOAA explains.</p>

<p id="text">Over on the Pacific Coast, sharks have been reported in coastal waters stretching along California, Alaska and Oregon.
Some of the sharks reported in the region include the broadnose sevengill shark (most abundant off the coast of Central California), the smooth hammerhead (found along Central California to the Gulf of California), megamouth shark (found in Southern California) and the leopard shark (in the waters from Oregon to Baja California and the northern part of the Gulf of California).
According to the Shark Research Committee, whale sharks, which can grow up to 40 feet and weigh as much as 40 tons according to some estimates- can be found "occasionally off Southern California."
White sharks have also been reported to be in the waters from the Gulf of Alaska to Gulf of California in mostly shallow coastal waters, according to the committee.
The NOAA says these apex predators, found mostly in temperate and subtropical waters, spend time both far out at sea as well as near the coasts.
In the northeastern Pacific region, "young of the year and juvenile white sharks" are commonly found along the Southern California Bight and further south into the Vizcaino Bay area of Mexico, according to the government body.
"White sharks expend a significant amount of energy migrating across the Pacific and need to accumulate as much energy as possible during their short feeding season in sanctuary waters," the NOAA explains.</p>
